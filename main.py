The Russian alphabet makes pronouncing the Russian language quite easy. Russian words almost always sound exactly as they are written. That means your Russian pronunciation will likely be much more advanced than if you were speaking another foreign language.

There are 10 vowels and 21 consonants in Russian:

–ì–ª–∞—Å–Ω—ã–µ –±—É–∫–≤—ã (vowels): –∞, —è, –æ, –µ, —É, —é, —ã, –∏, —ç, –µ. 

–°–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω—ã–µ –±—É–∫–≤—ã (consonants): –±, –ø, –≤, —Ñ, –≥, –∫, –¥, —Ç, –∑, —Å, –∂, —à, —â, —á, —Ö, –ª, –º, –Ω, —Ä, —Ü. –π. 

*–ë—É–∫–≤–∞ (pl. –±—É–∫–≤—ã) - a letter(s)

üó£ Task 1

Record yourself pronouncing the words and sentences and send your audio to the teacher if you have a premium subscription:

–¢–æ–º, –ò–Ω–Ω–∞ –∏ √Å–Ω–Ω–∞, –º√°–º–∞, –ø√°–ø–∞, –¥–æ–º, –æ–Ω, –æ–Ω–∞, —ç—Ç–æ, —Ç—É—Ç, —Ç–∞–º, –±–∞–Ω√°–Ω, –±–∞—Ç√≥–Ω, –Ω√≥—Ç–∞. –≠—Ç–æ –±–∞–Ω√°–Ω (this is a banana). –≠—Ç–æ –º√°–º–∞ –∏ –ø√°–ø–∞ (these are a mother and a father). –¢—É—Ç –¢–æ–º (Tom is here). –¢–∞–º –¥–æ–º (the house is there). 

Pay attention to the stress of the words!

As you‚Äôve probably noticed, reading in Russian is not that tough. However there are some rules to keep in mind:

1. O is pronounced like ‚Äúa‚Äù in case it‚Äôs not stressed (–æ–Ω–ê, –æ–≤–ê–ª, —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–û* [–∞])
2. Voiced letters (–±, –≥, –¥, –∑, –≤, –∂) are pronounced like their breath couples (–ø, –∫, —Ç, —Å, —Ñ, —à) if they are at the very end of a word (–≥–æ–¥ [—Ç] (even before —å ‚Äì –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å [—Ñ—å]) or if preceded by another breath letter (ex. –ª–æ–¥–∫–∞ [—Ç–∫]) Watch the video with examples ‚¨áÔ∏è""")

4. After consonants –≥, –∫, —Ö, –∂, —à, —â, —á  do NOT! write the letter —ã. Whenever an [—ã] or [–∏] sound follows one of these letters, it is spelled –∏. This is called 7-letter spelling rule.
ex. –∂–∏—Ä, —Ü–∏—Ä–∫, —à–∏—Ç—å, —á–∏–ø—Å—ã [—ã]

* Stressed letters are in capitals
